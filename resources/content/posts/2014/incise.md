# Static website generation with [incise][]

A few months of work and one spin off library later, I am now releasing a `0.1.0` version of incise
([see it on clojars](https://clojars.org/incise)).
I offer very little justification for providing the world with yet another option for static website generation; 
I simply felt that what was available was not ideal for me, and wanted my generator to be implemented in [Clojure][], my preferred language.

Your best introduction to incise is available on [its website][incise].
Coincidentally, that website is generated from [incise's README][readme].
Some highlights:

* Uses Clojure
* Allows many different setups and configurations
* Extensible by nature
* Batteries included
